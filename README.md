### Increment by One

#### Web Developer Coding Test

Thank you for applying for the role! Here we have a quick little HTML/CSS test.

Use `index.html` and `css/main.css` to build the design from `reference.png`. The fonts and colours you'll need are provided in `fonts-and-colours.png`.

There are image assets in `/images`, and a reset stylesheet has been included.

For the purposes of the exercise, the design should work on mobile devices between the widths of 320px and 420px (in portrait), and up to 810px (in landscape).

Comments are okay but, to keep the test anonymous, please don't include a git history.

Please **don't** spend more than 1 hour on this exercise. I've deliberately chosen a pretty simple design to keep the test short.

Once you're done, zip up the folder and upload it to at the URL supplied in the email. I'll review your work and we'll talk about your approach at the next step of the process.

Good luck!
